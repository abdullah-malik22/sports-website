  <h2>Indoor Sports</h2>
  <p>Indoor sports are those that take place within an enclosed space, usually under controlled conditions. These sports are often played during bad weather, or when space is limited.</p>
  
  <h3>Examples of Indoor Sports:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Basketball:</strong> Played inside a court, often in professional leagues.</li>
    <li><strong>Volleyball:</strong> Played indoors in many professional tournaments.</li>
    <li><strong>Table Tennis:</strong> Played on a small indoor table with rackets and a ball.</li>
    <li><strong>Badminton:</strong> Played indoors with rackets and a shuttlecock.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Outdoor Sports</h2>
  <p>Outdoor sports take place in open-air environments, often involving larger areas of land. They provide athletes with exposure to nature, and weather conditions can play a major role in the game.</p>
  
  <h3>Examples of Outdoor Sports:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Soccer:</strong> Played on large open fields with a ball and two goals.</li>
    <li><strong>Cricket:</strong> Played on a large grass field with bats, balls, and wickets.</li>
    <li><strong>Golf:</strong> Played on expansive courses with clubs and balls.</li>
    <li><strong>Tennis:</strong> Can be played both indoors and outdoors, but outdoor matches are very popular.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Differences Between Indoor and Outdoor Sports</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Weather Conditions:</strong> Outdoor sports are affected by weather, while indoor sports are less influenced by it.</li>
    <li><strong>Space and Equipment:</strong> Outdoor sports typically require larger spaces and more specialized equipment, while indoor sports can be played in smaller, more controlled areas.</li>
    <li><strong>Audience and Events:</strong> Outdoor sports often have larger audiences and are often held in stadiums, while indoor sports are usually confined to arenas.</li>
  </ul>
